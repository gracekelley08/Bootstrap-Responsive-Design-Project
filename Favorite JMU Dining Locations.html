                        <p class="lead">JMU's Panera is my all time favorite campus dining location. I've never had something at Panera that I didn't like. Located at Duke's Dining, the central location is very convenient. They are open from 7:30am-7:00pm from Monday-Thursday, 7:30am-3:00pm on Fridays, and 9:00am-3:00pm on Saturday/Sunday.  </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Pros: They offer many tasty meal options, are open for long hours, value meals for a cheaper price, a good seating area conductive for doing homework, and reletively fast service. </li>
                            <li>Cons: This location gets very busy at prime lunch hours (12-2pm) and there is no option to use a Duke Deal Punch. </li>
                            <li>Favorite Meal: Green Goddess Caprese Melt with Passion Fruit Papaya Green Tea. </li>

                        <h2>Oath Pizza</h2>
                        <p class="lead">Oath pizza makes thin-crust, personal pizzas with ingredients you can personalize. They offer vegan cheese and gluten-free crust. I believe that it's the best pizza on campus. They are located in Duke's Dining and open from 11:00am-3:00pm on weekdays. </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Pros: Oath is food sensitivity/allergy friendly, has generous portions for a punch, and has consistent quality. </li>
                            <li>Cons: It takes a while to get your order during busy lunch hours and they removed my favorite pizza, the "Bella," from the Duke Deal menu.</li>
                            <li>Favorite Meal: Whole Pepperoni Pizza with a fountain drink. </li>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Pros: They have a vaired selection/an option to customize bowls and the line is usually short.</li>
                            <li>Cons: A bit too small of a lunch serving if you're hungry.</li>
